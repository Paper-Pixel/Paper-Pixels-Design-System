# Paper-Pixels-Design-System (Alpha)

Pixel Starter Package. This is compiling all of my custom styles I copy and paste around my projects. _Please feel free to copy, remix, submite a PR_ Right now this is optimized for my workflow and neuro thought patterns.

## How is this built?

HTML is being compiled from [PUG][pug-link] and CSS is being compiled from [SASS][sass-link], Still just using Vanilla Javascript with a sprinkeling of ES6.

All of these langueges are being compiled with [CodeKit][codekit-link].
